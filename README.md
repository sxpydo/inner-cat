# inner-cat ðŸ˜º
This is the first project that I have created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
During my third week of the SheCodes Basics course, we were assigned a task to produce our very own webpage on a topic/subject that were a passionate about as the "Final Project."

Then I had decided to take this project to the next level, not only cover the content that I have learnt throughtout the 3 weeks but to make my webpage interactive for users. One of many thing that I am passionate about are Cats! They have always a special place in my heart. 
Instead of making my webpage factual, I added a twist of quirk and fun to attract my audience with the influence of reading a book during lockdown 2.0 called "Some Very Interesting Cats Perhaps You Weren't Aware Of" by Doogie Horner. An illustrated book of short stories and cartoons about cats, most of which are comical.

Using the images from the book to form my inner cats that can relate to my audience following by keeping the influence of formatting style and color palettes from the book.
